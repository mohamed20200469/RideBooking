# RideBooking
This is my first .NET web API, done during my internship period at iskraemco and under the supervision of my senior backend developers. It is a web API for ride booking.

This API is created in a way to create a different perspective for each role of users.
The driver should be able to retrieve the booking requests and accept them and start and end rides and calculate fares.
The rider should be able to create booking requests and rate rides.
The admin should be able to retrieve all data.
